# Binary Search Algorithm

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Binary Search algorithm in Python. Binary Search is an efficient algorithm used to find the position of a target element within a sorted array or list. It reduces the search space by half in every iteration, making it faster than linear search methods.

## Features
- Efficiently searches for an element in a sorted list.
- Returns the index of the target element or indicates if the element is not found.
- Can handle various data sizes for demonstration.

## How It Works
Binary Search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half:
1. It compares the target value with the middle element of the array.
2. If the target matches the middle element, the search ends.
3. If the target is smaller than the middle element, it focuses on the left half of the array.
4. If the target is larger, it focuses on the right half of the array.
This process continues until the target is found or the interval is empty.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-search.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd binary-search`

## Usage
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the `binary_search.py` file:
   ```bash
   python binary_search.py
